## Website Outline

![StudentHire Scheme](StudentHire_scheme.png)
Format: ![Schema](url)


### Static Pages:

### Home Page
- Landing page somewhat similar to what it is now, except with a video background showing
short snippets of a few different tasks being completed by students. Media bar visible along
bottom and tool bar on the top.
- Keep mission statement underneath this.
- How it works section.
- how it works video
- how it works step by step click through the site process
- A section for insurance and talking about the protection for homeowners and students.
- A bar that keeps track of the running total that StudentHire has made for students. “Students
have completed _____ jobs and have made $______ on StudentHire”
- Keep the icons that explain the different tasks that we offer. When you click on one of the
icons it should take you to the job request form that is specific to that job.
- Then we should have a carousel of a few of our top students that you can scroll through and
get a glimpse of what the site is like in terms of its students. This should just be a short little
review of the students profile (Picture, school, program, rating out of five stars, start of one
review etc…)
- This should be followed by a testimonial section (The testimonials need to be awesome,
complete with a picture and where the review was taken from.)
- The bottom bar should contain the logo, contact us, terms and conditions, address, phone
number, email and all of our social media logos that are linked to our pages.
### About us Page
-We would want an about us page that tells a little bit about our story and our team. (Again we
would provide the content on this.
### FAQ
-We would need a frequently asked questions page (we would provide the content).
